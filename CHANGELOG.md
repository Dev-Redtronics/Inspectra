# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

### Baseline

- `inspectra baseline create` records the current findings of a package in a committed
  `inspectra-baseline.json`, and `inspectra baseline prune` removes the fixed ones without ever adding
  any. `--only scan,lint,style,trivy` selects scopes, `--recursive` covers nested packages; a scope
  that cannot run completely exits with `69` and writes nothing.
- `scan`, `audit`, `typosquat`, `trivy`, `lint`, `style`, `check` and the `build_runner` builders leave
  out recorded findings. Entries are matched by scope, source, rule, package and file, without line
  numbers or package versions, and count their occurrences. `inspect`, `add` and `trust` do not use the
  baseline.
- The `baseline:` configuration section: `enabled`, `file`, `max_severity`, `fail_on_stale`; the
  public `BaselineConfig` and `BaselineSummary`, and the `baseline` field of `InspectraConfig`,
  `StyleResult`, `LintResult` and `ScanResult`.
- JSON: `baselined` in the reports of `scan` and `audit`, and `baseline` with `covered` and `stale` in
  the results of `lint`, `style` and the Trivy scans, present only when a baseline was applied.

### Dependency policy

- The `dependency_policy:` section turns organisation rules for dependencies into checks, each opt-in:
  `DENIED_PACKAGE` (also transitive), `PACKAGE_NOT_ALLOWED`, `DISALLOWED_HOST` (registries and Git
  hosts, also transitive), `MISSING_UPPER_BOUND`, `SDK_BELOW_POLICY`, `DEV_ONLY_DEPENDENCY`,
  `MISSING_PUBLISH_TO`, `MISSING_METADATA`, `LOCKFILE_OUT_OF_SYNC`, `MISSING_CHECKSUM`,
  `UNUSED_DEPENDENCY` and `DEV_DEPENDENCY_IN_LIB`, all of the source `pubspec`.
- `inspectra deps [directory] [-r] [--fix]` runs the pubspec rules and the policy without network
  access, for every package of a workspace with `-r`; `--fix` bounds constraints with a caret, moves
  development packages to `dev_dependencies` and adds `publish_to: none`, keeping comments and
  formatting.
- `constraint_style: caret|range|pinned` reports `CONSTRAINT_STYLE` (low) for hosted constraints written
  otherwise; `--fix` rewrites caret and range constraints into each other and exact versions into
  either.
- `overrides.require_reason` with `overrides.allowed` (`name`, `reason`, `expires`, collected across
  layers) reports `UNJUSTIFIED_OVERRIDE` (medium) for overrides without a valid justification; a
  justified override no longer reports `DEPENDENCY_OVERRIDE`.
- `lockfile_policy: committed|ignored|auto` reports `LOCKFILE_POLICY` (medium) when Git tracks
  `pubspec.lock` against the policy; `auto` asks applications to commit it and publishable packages
  not to. `deps` and `check` apply it.
- `max_major_behind` and `max_libyear` with `libyear_scope: direct|all` report `OUTDATED_MAJOR` and
  `LIBYEAR_EXCEEDED` (medium) from the version listings of the registry, cached for a day:
  `deps --online`, `check` and `report` check them unless offline. JSON of `deps`: `outdatedChecked`
  and `libyears`. A policy's `minimum` may only lower both limits.
- Library: `ConstraintStyle`, `LockfilePolicy`, `LibyearScope`, `AllowedOverride` and the matching
  fields of `DependencyPolicyConfig`, `ConfigStrictness.lowerNumber`.
- `scan` applies the policy to its pubspecs, and `check` runs it as the step "Dependency policy"
  while `dependency_policy.enabled` is set.
- New runtime dependency: `yaml_edit`, for the fixes.
- Library: `DependencyPolicyConfig`, `DeniedPackage` and `InspectraConfig.dependencyPolicy`.

### Configuration tools

- `inspectra config show` prints the effective configuration as YAML; `--explain` comments every
  value with its origin (file and line, environment variable, command line or default) and
  `--only-changed` leaves out the defaults. `-f json` lists `key`, `value`, `default`, `origin`,
  `variable` and `line` per option.
- `inspectra config validate` checks the configuration and that every file it refers to exists, and
  lists all problems at once (exit code `65`).
- `inspectra config lint` reports risky settings as findings of the new source `config`:
  `CONFIG_INSECURE_URL`, `CONFIG_UNKNOWN_VARIABLE`, `CONFIG_TRIVY_DISABLED`, `CONFIG_UNPINNED_TRIVY`,
  `CONFIG_IGNORE_EXPIRED`, `CONFIG_IGNORE_WITHOUT_EXPIRY`, `CONFIG_GATE_NOT_FAILING`,
  `CONFIG_MIN_SEVERITY`, `CONFIG_NO_COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` and `CONFIG_BASELINE_UNBOUNDED`.
- `inspectra config schema` prints the JSON Schema of `inspectra.yaml`, generated from the code and
  published as `inspectra.schema.json`; `inspectra.example.yaml` starts with its
  `yaml-language-server` modeline.
- Unknown keys in the configuration file, in `ignore` entries and on the command line name the closest
  valid option: `Did you mean "secret"?`.
- Renamed options keep working under their old names until the next major version: every command
  warns, `config lint` reports `CONFIG_DEPRECATED_OPTION`, and the old and the new name side by side
  are an error. Library: `ConfigDeprecation`, `configDeprecations`, `DeprecatedOption` and
  `InspectraConfig.deprecatedOptions`.
- Library: `ConfigRecorder`, `ConfigEntry`, `ConfigKind`, `ConfigOrigin`, `ConfigOverride`,
  `ConfigOverrides.resolve` and `knownPaths`, a `recorder` parameter of `loadConfig`,
  `InspectraConfig.parse` and `InspectraConfig.fromSources`, and `FindingSource.config`.
- `inspectra config init [--preset app|library|plugin|enterprise] [--stdout] [--force]` writes a
  starting `inspectra.yaml` for the kind of package, detected from `pubspec.yaml`.
- `inspectra config migrate [--dry-run]` replaces the old names of renamed options in the
  configuration file and its profiles, keeping values, comments and order.
- `inspectra config diff <a> [<b>] [--fail-on-weaker]` compares two configurations, files or
  `git:<revision>`, with the effective configuration by default, and marks values that got weaker.
- `trivy.filesystem.scanners` accepts scanner names in any case, like the severities.

### Reports and dashboards

- `inspectra report` runs every evaluation - supply chain, dependencies, configuration, format, lint,
  style, public API, changelog, each configured Trivy scan and coverage - and reports each as a section
  with status, summary, key figures and findings. Package checks that are not enabled are reported as
  skipped with the option that enables them; an evaluation that cannot run is reported with its cause
  while the others still run, and the command exits with `69` after writing the report, also with
  `--exit-zero`. `--skip` leaves out sections, `--also <format>=<path>` writes further formats from
  the same run and `--merge` combines JSON reports of earlier runs.
- `-f html` writes a self-contained, offline HTML dashboard in the style of shadcn/ui: a sidebar with
  every evaluation, key figure cards, charts of findings by severity, line coverage and code
  composition, a table of the evaluations, a filterable finding explorer and an accordion with the
  details of each evaluation - coverage per file, the API diff, the code base per directory; light and
  dark mode, responsive and printable, with a content security policy that allows only its own inline
  stylesheet and script.
- The codebase section of `report` counts the lines of every Dart file: code with and without
  comments, comment and documentation lines, blank lines, the comment ratio and TODO markers, per
  directory and for the largest files, apart from generated files; and the dependencies of
  `pubspec.yaml` and `pubspec.lock`.
- New output formats for every command with `--format`: `junit`, `gitlab` (Code Quality, with
  fingerprints that survive moved lines), `sonarqube` (generic issue import) and `checkstyle`.
- The package check results become findings of the new source `quality`: `UNFORMATTED`, lint codes,
  `API_CHANGED`, `API_DUMP_MISSING`, `CHANGELOG_PROBLEM` and `COVERAGE_BELOW_THRESHOLD`.
- Library: `FindingSource.quality` and `FindingSource.tryParse`, `Finding.fromJson`.
- New runtime dependency: `xml`, for the JUnit and Checkstyle reports.

### Configuration inheritance and central policies

- `extends:` builds a configuration on bases: paths relative to the declaring file, `package:` files
  resolved through `.dart_tool/package_config.json`, and `https` URLs pinned by their SHA-256, which
  are verified and cached. Bases nest; mappings merge key by key, scalars and lists of the higher
  layer win, `key: ~` resets a value, and `ignore` and `dependency_policy.denied` collect the entries
  of every layer. License headers, secret rules and CA bundles named in a base resolve relative to it.
- A list option written as `key+:` adds to the list of the lower layers, or to the default, instead
  of replacing it: `dependency_policy.dev_only+: [golden_toolkit]`. The JSON Schema describes the
  `+` variant of every list option.
- `policy:` with `locked` options and `minimum` values binds every layer above its file, including
  `INSPECTRA_*` variables and the command line (`--set`, `--fail-on`, `coverage --min`); a violation is
  a configuration error naming the option, its origin and the policy.
- `profiles:` holds named partial configurations that `--profile <name>` or `INSPECTRA_PROFILE`
  applies above the project's own configuration and below environment variables and the command line;
  profiles of the bases and the project merge, policies bind them, and they cannot set `extends`,
  `policy` or `profiles`. `config validate` checks every profile and lists them as `profiles` in its
  JSON, `config show` records the selected one as `profile`. `check`, `format`, `lint`, `coverage`,
  `api check|dump` and `changelog check` take `--profile` as well.
- Text values and list elements can refer to environment variables: `${env:NAME}`,
  `${env:NAME:-default}`, and `$${` for a literal `${`. An unset variable without a default is a
  configuration error. `config show` prints the reference instead of the resolved value and marks it
  with `"interpolated": true`; policies check the resolved value. Library: `ConfigEntry.template` and
  `ConfigEntry.shown`.
- `policy.forbid_ignore_of: [critical]` keeps findings of these severities reported whatever ignores
  them: `ignore` rules of any layer, `--ignore` and the baseline. A finding an ignore matched carries
  the attribute `ignoreForbidden`.
- `inspectra config fetch` downloads and verifies remote bases for offline runs and `build_runner`;
  every command fetches missing bases first. `config show --explain` names the base and line of each
  value, `config show -f json` adds `layers` and `file`, and `config lint` reports
  `CONFIG_PUBSPEC_SECTION_IGNORED`. The JSON Schema describes `extends` and `policy`.
- Library: `ConfigLayer`, `ConfigLayerKind`, `ConfigLayerStack`, `ConfigBaseReference`,
  `ConfigPolicy`, `ConfigStrictness`, `InspectraConfig.fromLayers`, `ConfigEntry.file`,
  `ConfigRecorder.layers`, `InspectraConfigException.file`, `NetworkConfig.withResolvedPaths`, and
  `cacheRoot`/`packageRoot` parameters of `loadConfig` and `InspectraConfig.fromSources`,
  `ConfigPolicy.forbidIgnoreOf`, `InspectraConfig.forbiddenIgnoreSeverities`,
  `Finding.withAttributes` and `ConfigLayerKind.profile`.

### Semantic versioning from the API dump

- `inspectra api semver [--from <revision>]` compares the API dump committed at the last release tag
  (`changelog.tag_prefix`, read with `git show`) with the API of the current code, classifies every
  change as breaking or additive with a reason, and checks that the `version` of `pubspec.yaml` makes
  the required step: major for breaking changes, minor for additions, with Dart's rule before 1.0.0;
  a pre-release counts as its release. Removed declarations and members, changed signatures, types,
  default and constant values, added enum values and new abstract members are breaking; new
  declarations, deprecations and optional parameters of members nobody can override are additive.
- Findings `SEMVER_VIOLATION` (high, `pubspec.yaml`) and, with `changelog.enabled`,
  `SEMVER_UNDECLARED_BREAKING` (medium) when no commit since the release announces a breaking change.
  Without a release tag, a dump at the release or a version the check is skipped and exits with `0`.
- `api.semver: true` adds the step "API semver" to `check` and the section "Semantic versioning"
  (`--skip semver`) to `report`.
- Library: `checkSemver`, `evaluateSemver`, `SemverResult`, `classifyApiChanges`, `ApiChange`,
  `ApiChangeKind`, `ApiSurface`, `ApiDeclaration`, `ApiConfig.semver`, and the Git types `GitHistory`
  (with `show` and `hasCommits`), `GitCommit`, `ReleaseTag`, `ConventionalCommit` and `VersionBump`.

### Workspace policy

- The `workspace_policy:` section states the rules of a pub workspace at its root: `align_versions`
  (`off`, `compatible`, `exact`), `require_membership`, `same_sdk`, `forbid_cycles`,
  `include_dev_dependencies` and architecture `layers` with `packages` globs, `may_depend_on`,
  `isolated` and `forbidden_dependencies`, collected across configuration layers.
- Findings of the new source `workspace`: `WORKSPACE_MEMBER_MISSING`, `WORKSPACE_RESOLUTION_MISSING`,
  `WORKSPACE_VERSION_MISMATCH`, `WORKSPACE_SDK_MISMATCH`, `DEPENDENCY_CYCLE`, `LAYER_VIOLATION`,
  `FORBIDDEN_DEPENDENCY` and `LAYER_UNASSIGNED`. `deps -r` applies them at a workspace root, `check`
  as the step "Workspace policy", `report` in its dependencies section.
- `inspectra graph [directory] [-f text|dot|mermaid|json] [--include-dev] [--external]` draws the
  dependencies between the packages of a workspace, grouped by layer.
- `inspectra workspace affected --since <revision> [-f text|json]` lists the packages the changes
  since a Git revision affect, with every package depending on them; `deps -r --changed-since
  <revision>` checks only those.
- Library: `WorkspacePolicyConfig`, `WorkspaceLayer`, `VersionAlignment`,
  `InspectraConfig.workspacePolicy`, `FindingSource.workspace` and `GitHistory.changedFiles`.

### Developer experience

- `inspectra explain [RULE_ID] [-f text|markdown|json]` explains a rule offline - source, default
  severity, what it reports, why it matters and how to resolve it - from a catalog of every fixed rule
  id, or lists them all; advisory ids point to OSV.dev, a misspelled id gets the closest rule. The new
  Rule reference in the documentation lists every rule.
- `inspectra doctor [--offline] [-f json]` checks the configuration, the Dart and Flutter SDKs against
  the pubspec and `.fvmrc`, Git, Trivy, proxy, CA bundle, the reachability of OSV.dev, the registry
  and the Trivy releases, the token of a private registry and the cache, and exits with `1` when a
  check failed.
- `inspectra hook run` runs the checks of the new `hook.checks` (`audit`, `typosquat`, `deps`,
  `format`, `style`; default `[audit, typosquat]`) on the files staged for the commit, the dependency
  and style checks on the staged content. The pre-commit hook now calls it; `inspectra hook install`
  updates an installed hook.
- Library: `HookConfig`, `HookCheck`, `InspectraConfig.hook`, and `GitHistory.stagedFiles` and
  `stagedContent`.

### Changed

- `deps -r` at the root of a pub workspace checks the packages its `workspace:` list names instead of
  every `pubspec.yaml` below it, so a standalone `example/` package is no longer included. `scan -r`
  now also checks the pubspecs of workspace members, which share the root lockfile.
- `ANY_VERSION` and `WILDCARD_VERSION` no longer report dependencies on packages of the same pub
  workspace, which pub resolves to the workspace's own copy.

### Fixed

- A list or mapping where the configuration expects another kind of value, such as
  `style.rules: [no_else]`, is reported as a configuration error instead of crashing with exit code `70`.
- `trivy.executable` is a known option again while `INSPECTRA_TRIVY` is set: the key in the
  configuration file no longer fails as an unknown option, and `--trivy-executable` or
  `--set trivy.executable=…` now wins over `INSPECTRA_TRIVY` as the command line should.
- Git runs in the C locale, so a translated Git no longer breaks `api semver`, `changelog` and the
  semver step of `check`: an empty repository or an unknown revision failed with exit code `69` instead
  of being recognised. `ProcessRunner.run` takes an `environment` for this.

## 1.0.0

### Package quality gates

- Trivy scans for secrets, dependency licenses, dependency vulnerabilities and a plain filesystem
  scan, configurable per scan and runnable from `build_runner` or the `inspectra` command line.
- Public API dump of every public library, written by the `inspectra:api` builder and checked with
  `build_runner build --only-check` or `inspectra api check`; constants and `const` primary
  constructors are recorded and changes are shown as a unified diff.
- Coverage gate on top of `package:coverage` with an optional line coverage threshold; files marked
  `// coverage:ignore-file` are not listed as untested.
- Format check (`dart format`) and lint check (`dart analyze`, `fail_on: error|warning|info|none`)
  with `--fix`, as the first steps of `check`, and as `build_runner` builders.
- A strict lint preset, `package:inspectra/lints/strict.yaml`.
- Style check (`inspectra style`, a step of `check`, the `inspectra:style` builder) with rules no lint
  covers: `license_header` from a template with `{year}`, `public_docs`, `private_docs`,
  `one_type_per_file`, `one_public_type_per_file`, `file_named_after_type`, `no_comments`,
  `no_else`, `no_default_case` and `no_wildcard_case`; the presets `none`, `recommended` (fits
  Flutter's widget-plus-private-`State` files) and `strict`, per-rule switches,
  `// inspectra: ignore-style` and `ignore-style-file` comments, and text, JSON, Markdown and SARIF
  output.
- Custom style rules: `package:inspectra/style.dart` with `StyleRule`, `StyleFile`, `StyleReporter`
  and `StyleChecker`; the files of `style.custom_rules` are run by a generated program through
  `dart run`, so they work with the compiled executable as well.
- Writerside documentation in `docs/`, published to GitHub Pages.

### Changelog

- `inspectra changelog generate` writes the section of the next release from the Conventional Commits
  since the latest release tag, in the Keep a Changelog layout: breaking changes first, then Added,
  Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed and Security, with commit and comparison links. It suggests the
  next semantic version, drops commits reverted within the release, and with `--write` adds the section
  to `CHANGELOG.md` without touching existing sections. `--from`, `--to`, `--release`, `--date`.
- `inspectra changelog check`, also part of `check` with `changelog.enabled`, validates the changelog
  and fails when the version of `pubspec.yaml` is not documented.
- `inspectra changelog notes [version]` prints the section of a release; the release workflow uses it
  as the description of the GitHub release.
- The `changelog:` configuration section: `enabled`, `file`, `tag_prefix`, `types`, `unconventional`,
  `repository`, `commit_url`, `compare_url`; `checkChangelog` in the library API.

### Supply-chain security

Every command of `dart_audit` 0.3.1 with the same names, flags, rule ids, JSON fields and the exit
codes `0`, `1` and `64`:

- `scan`, the default command: OSV.dev audit, pubspec rules, typosquatting, dependency confusion
  and a Trivy filesystem scan in one report, with `--recursive` for monorepos and pub workspaces.
- `audit`, `inspect`, `trust [version]`, `typosquat`, `add [--dev] [--force] [--dry-run]`, `hook`.
- Output formats `json` (versioned), `sarif` (GitHub code scanning) and `markdown`; `--output`,
  `--fail-on`, `--min-severity`, `--ignore`, `--exit-zero`, `--offline`, `--quiet`, `--verbose`,
  `--color`.
- Ignore rules with mandatory reason, optional package scope and expiry date.
- Proxy, custom CA bundle, `PUB_HOSTED_URL`, OSV mirror, retries with back-off and `Retry-After`,
  response size limits and an OSV advisory cache.

Fixed compared to `dart_audit`: full OSV records with pagination, CVSS v3/v2 scoring and per-range
fix versions; checksum verified, in-memory package inspection without zip-slip or decompression
bombs; the archive and pubspec scanners actually run; correct pub.dev trust endpoints for the
requested version; code point based Unicode scanning; exact URL host matching; far fewer typosquat
false positives; `add` installs exactly the inspected version and works with Flutter on Windows.

### Trivy provisioning

- Trivy is taken from `trivy.executable` / `INSPECTRA_TRIVY`, the `PATH`, package manager
  directories or Inspectra's cache, or downloaded for Linux, macOS and Windows when the download host
  is reachable, with mandatory SHA-256 verification against the release checksums and atomic
  installation. `mode`, `version` (`latest` included), `download`, `use_installed`, mirrors and the
  database repository are configurable. `inspectra trivy --install` and `--where`; `--where`
  never downloads.
- `--offline` and `network.offline` keep Trivy offline as well: every scan, including the builders,
  starts it with `--skip-db-update --offline-scan`.

### Configuration and command line

- One configuration, in the `inspectra:` section of `pubspec.yaml` or in `inspectra.yaml`, with
  strict validation of every key; configuration errors name the key and, for YAML syntax errors, the
  line and column.
- Every option can be overridden with `INSPECTRA_*` environment variables and `--set key=value`.
- Exit codes follow `sysexits.h`: `65` for invalid input or configuration, `69` for unavailable
  services and tools, `70` for internal errors.
