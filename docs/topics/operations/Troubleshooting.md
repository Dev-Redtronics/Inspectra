<link-summary>The errors and surprises you are most likely to meet, and what to do about each.</link-summary>

<card-summary>Configuration errors, Trivy failures, stale builds, missing findings and coverage puzzles.</card-summary>

Start with `dart run %package% doctor`: it checks the configuration, the SDKs, Git, Trivy, the proxy, the CA bundle,
the registry token, the network and the cache at once, and says what to do. `dart run %package% explain <RULE_ID>`
explains any finding. See [Doctor](Doctor.md) and the [Rule reference](Rule-Reference.md).

## Configuration

### Invalid Inspectra configuration at "…": unknown option {collapsible="true"}

A key is misspelled or at the wrong level. The message lists the valid keys at that position:

```text
Invalid Inspectra configuration at "inspectra.trivy.secrets": unknown option. Known options here: cache_directory, connectivity_timeout, db_repository, download, download_base_url, enabled, executable, extra_args, filesystem, install_directory, latest_release_url, license, mode, report_directory, secret, skip_db_update, timeout, use_installed, version, vulnerability.
```

Here `secrets` should be `secret`. See the [configuration reference](Configuration-Reference.md). The command exits
with `65`.

### Invalid Inspectra configuration at "…": unknown option given on the command line {collapsible="true"}

A `--set` key is misspelled. `--set` takes the dotted path of an option, such as `--set trivy.version=latest`.

### expected true or false, got "yes" {collapsible="true"}

YAML 1.2 reads `yes`, `no`, `on` and `off` as strings. Write `true` and `false` in the file; only `--set` and
`INSPECTRA_*` variables also accept `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `1` and `0`.

### Undefined alias {collapsible="true"}

```text
Invalid Inspectra configuration at "pubspec.yaml": line 5, column 16: Undefined alias.
```

An unquoted glob starting with `*` is read as a YAML alias. Quote it: `'**.dart'`.

### My settings in pubspec.yaml are ignored {collapsible="true"}

An `%config_file%` exists in the package root, or `--config` or `INSPECTRA_CONFIG` names another file. It takes
precedence entirely; the two are not merged. Move everything into one of them.

### A setting has no effect {collapsible="true"}

An `INSPECTRA_*` environment variable or a `--set` value overrides the file. Check the environment of the process, for
example with `env | grep INSPECTRA_`. See [Overriding options](Configuration-Overview.md#overrides).

## build_runner

### Editing inspectra.yaml or trivy-secret.yaml does not rerun the builders {collapsible="true"}

They are not <tooltip term="build source">build sources</tooltip> by default. Move the configuration into
`pubspec.yaml`, or add the files to the sources - see [Build sources](Build-Sources.md). To rerun once:
`dart run build_runner clean` and build again.

### api.output changed from "…" to "…". Restart build_runner {collapsible="true"}

`build_runner` reads the output location when it starts. Stop `watch` or `serve` and start it again.

### --only-check fails with "I api/&lt;package&gt;.api" {collapsible="true"}

The committed dump is out of date. The warning above it shows the diff. Run `dart run build_runner build` and commit
the dump - after deciding the change is intended. See [Workflow](API-Workflow.md#fixing-a-failed-check).

### The secret scan of the builder misses a file the command line finds {collapsible="true"}

The builder only sees build sources. Root-level files such as `.env` or `analysis_options.yaml` are not sources by
default. Add them to the sources, or rely on the command line in CI.

## Format and lint

### The format check fails on files I never touched {collapsible="true"}

A new SDK can change `dart format`'s output, and a changed `formatter: page_width` reformats everything. Run
`dart run %package% format --fix` once and commit the result on its own.

### "dart format" failed with exit code 65 {collapsible="true"}

The command exits with `69`: a file does not parse; the formatter's message names the file, line and column. Fix the syntax error - the lint check
reports it too.

### The format check complains about generated code {collapsible="true"}

The generator writes with its own page width. Add the file pattern to `format.exclude`; the defaults already cover
`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart` and `*.mocks.dart`.

### The lint check reports errors in generated files that do not exist yet {collapsible="true"}

Run code generation first: `dart run build_runner build`. On build, the `inspectra:lint` builder already runs after
every code generator.

### A rule I disabled is still reported {collapsible="true"}

Disable a rule of an included file with the map form, `rule_name: false`; listing rules adds them. See
[Lint preset](Lint-Preset.md#adjusting-it).

## Style check {id="style"}

### The license header template … does not exist {collapsible="true"}

`style.license_header` names a file relative to the package root. With the builder, the template must also be a
[build source](Build-Sources.md); files under `tool/` are by default.

### The custom style rules … could not be run {collapsible="true"}

The generated program did not compile or crashed; the compiler output follows the message. Check that every file of
`style.custom_rules` declares a top level `styleRules` of type `List<StyleRule>`, that `inspectra` is a dependency of
the package, and that `dart pub get` ran. See [How custom rules run](Style-Custom-Rules.md#how-it-works).

### An ignore comment is reported by no_comments {collapsible="true"}

`no_comments` forbids every comment except documentation, ignore comments included. Leave such files out with
`style.exclude`, or switch the rule off with `rules: {no_comments: false}`.

### A rule I switched off still runs {collapsible="true"}

`rules` wins over `preset`, but its keys are rule ids: `no_else`, not `no-else` or `NoElse`. An id that does not exist
is an error rather than ignored, so check the spelling in the message.

## Trivy

`dart run %package% trivy --where` shows which Trivy the command line would use and where it comes from.

### Trivy skipped: Trivy is not installed and … {collapsible="true"}

The command line found no Trivy and could not download one. The message says why:

| Message | Fix |
|:--|:--|
| `… downloading is disabled (trivy.download: false).` | Install Trivy, or allow the download |
| `… cannot be downloaded in offline mode.` | Run once without `--offline`, or install Trivy |
| `… github.com is not reachable, so it was not downloaded.` | Allow the host, set `network.proxy`, or point `trivy.download_base_url` at a mirror |
| `The configured Trivy executable "…" (trivy.executable) cannot be run.` | Fix `trivy.executable` or `%trivy_env%`, which disable every other lookup |
| `Trivy publishes no build for …` | Install Trivy manually and set `trivy.executable` |
| `Trivy <version> is neither installed nor cached; "inspectra trivy --install" downloads it.` | Printed by `trivy --where`, which never downloads; exit code `69`. Run `dart run %package% trivy --install` |

In `auto` mode `scan` continues without Trivy; in `required` mode, and for the configured scans of `trivy` and
`check`, the command exits with `69`. See [Installing Trivy](Trivy-Installation.md#provisioning).

### Could not start Trivy ("trivy"): No such file or directory {collapsible="true"}

A builder could not start Trivy: it is not installed or not on the `PATH` of the process running `build_runner`.
Install it, or set `trivy.executable` or `%trivy_env%`. In IDEs started from a desktop launcher, the `PATH` may differ
from your shell's. See [Installing Trivy](Trivy-Installation.md#builder-lookup).

### Trivy did not finish scanning …: it exited with 1 {collapsible="true"}

Trivy itself failed; its error output follows the message. Common causes:

| Trivy says | Cause | Fix |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `failed to download vulnerability DB` | No network, or the registry is blocked | Allow `mirror.gcr.io`, set `TRIVY_DB_REPOSITORY` to a mirror, or use an offline database |
| `unknown flag` | A very old Trivy | Update Trivy |
| `secret config file … error` | Invalid `%secret_config%` | Fix the YAML or the regular expression |
| `cache may be in use by another process` | Two Trivy processes share a cache | Run scans one after another, or give them separate `TRIVY_CACHE_DIR`s |

### The first vulnerability scan is slow {collapsible="true"}

It downloads the Trivy database, about 120 MB. Later scans reuse it. In CI, cache it - see
[CI integration](CI-Integration.md#the-trivy-database-cache).

## Findings

### A secret in test/ or example/ is not reported {collapsible="true"}

Trivy's built-in allow rules suppress findings in test and example directories and in Markdown files. Disable them in
`%secret_config%` - see [Secret rules](Trivy-Secret-Rules.md#built-in-allow-rules).

### The license scan reports UNKNOWN for a well-known package {collapsible="true"}

`unclassified`: the package's license file has text Trivy cannot match, for example a license with an added clause.
Read it; if acceptable, add the package to `ignored_packages`.
`no-license-file`: the package ships none, or it is not in the pub cache - run `dart pub get`.

### The license scan finds nothing at all {collapsible="true"}

By default it reports only forbidden, restricted and unknown licenses, and most of pub.dev is BSD, MIT or Apache. Add
`LOW` to its `severity` to see every license.

### The vulnerability scan reports a dev dependency {collapsible="true"}

It includes `dev_dependencies` by default. Upgrade it, or set `include_dev_dependencies: false` if build-time tooling
is out of scope for you.

## Coverage

### "dart test --coverage=…" failed with exit code 1 {collapsible="true"}

A test failed; its output is above the message, and the command exits with `69`. Coverage is not measured for a failing suite - fix the test first.

### A file is listed as "not loaded by any test" {collapsible="true"}

No test imports it, directly or indirectly, so the VM reports nothing for it. Import it from a test, or mark it
`// coverage:ignore-file` if it is not meant to be tested.

### Coverage differs from what my IDE shows {collapsible="true"}

The IDE may count different files: %product% reports only `report_on` minus `exclude` and drops lines marked with
`coverage:ignore` comments. Point the IDE at `coverage/lcov.info` to see exactly what %product% measured.

### The coverage of generated files is counted {collapsible="true"}

Add their pattern to `coverage.exclude`. Remember that setting `exclude` replaces the defaults.

## Changelog {id="changelog"}

### warning: The repository is a shallow clone {collapsible="true"}

The clone has only the latest commits and no tags, so the previous release cannot be found and older commits are
missing. Fetch everything with `fetch-depth: 0` in `actions/checkout`, or locally with
`git fetch --unshallow --tags`. See [Releasing in CI](Changelog-Releasing.md#ci).

### There is no release tag and pubspec.yaml declares no valid version {collapsible="true"}

No tag starting with `changelog.tag_prefix` and a semantic version is reachable from `--to`, so there is nothing to
count the version from. Set `version:` in `pubspec.yaml` for the first release, or pass `--release 1.0.0`. If your
tags look like `1.0.0` or `release-1.0.0`, set `tag_prefix` to `''` or `release-`.

### The changelog repeats changes that were already released {collapsible="true"}

The previous release was not found: the tag is missing locally (`git fetch --tags`), it does not start with
`tag_prefix`, or it is not reachable from `--to`, for example because the release was tagged on another branch. Pass
the previous release with `--from v1.1.0`.

### No changes to release, although there are commits {collapsible="true"}

Every commit since the last release is hidden: `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore` and the other hidden types, types that
are not mapped, and commits that do not follow Conventional Commits. Give them a section in
[`changelog.types`](Changelog-Configuration.md#types) or `changelog.unconventional`.

### … already has a section for version 1.2.0 {collapsible="true"}

`--write` never documents a version twice. Edit the existing section by hand, or release another version with
`--release`.

### Git cannot resolve the range {collapsible="true"}

The revision given with `--from` or `--to` does not exist in the clone. Tags and branches of other remotes have to be
fetched first; a commit can be given by its hash.

### Version 1.2.0 of pubspec.yaml has no section {collapsible="true"}

`changelog check` requires a section for the version in `pubspec.yaml`. Generate it with
`dart run %package% changelog generate --write --release 1.2.0`, or write it by hand.

## Still stuck

Run the failing command with the scan or check isolated - `dart run %package% trivy secret`,
`dart run %package% api check` - and open an issue at [%issues%](%issues%) with the output and the
`%pubspec_key%:` configuration.
