<link-summary>Every rule %product% reports, with its source, its default severity and what it reports; inspectra explain prints the details of one.</link-summary>

<card-summary>Every rule id with source, severity and what it reports; inspectra explain RULE_ID for the details.</card-summary>

```bash
dart run %package% explain MISSING_UPPER_BOUND     # why it matters and how to resolve it
dart run %package% explain -f markdown             # this list
```

`inspectra explain` works offline. It finds a rule in any case, points advisory ids such as `GHSA-…` or `CVE-…` to
OSV.dev, and suggests the closest rule for a misspelled id. Advisories of the OSV.dev audit, the rules of Trivy and the
diagnostics of `dart analyze` carry ids of their own and are not listed here. A rule's severity can be suppressed with
`ignore` rules, and a policy can forbid ignoring severities with
[`forbid_ignore_of`](Configuration-Inheritance.md#policy).
